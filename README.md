# House-Price-Prediction-Aimes, IA

There are various regression approaches that can be used in predicting the numerical value of the target variable in Machine Learning. In this project, I will be exploring the use of Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression in order to determine the tool that will provide the best result.

The dataset that I will be using was obtained from a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) that involves the prediction of house values in Aimes, IA. The dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. 

The goal of this project is to identify the features best asssociated with the target variable (SalePrice) while attempting to reduce the multicollinearity among  the features.
